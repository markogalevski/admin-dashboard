# The Odin Project Intermediate HTML/CSS Capstone Project

This is the final project of this Odin project front end web development course. During this course I covered working with grids, svgs, form inputs,
and general intermediate positioning and concepts such as designing forms with accessibility and client-side validation in mind.

This project focuses the most on using Grid and positioning. See the "dashboard-project.png" for the reference image"
